TestSample
==========

A sample project to demonstrate my basic skills to development of iOS apps

This project uses UITabbarViewController as its root view controller. In UITabarViewController, 
there are three sub ViewController,
   
    1. Basic Login View: When the user presses validate button, the program will validate the
       input information. For keeping simple, it validates if the password is longer than 3 letters.
    
    2. UITableView with UIWebview: When the user presses any table cell, it will conduct user to related
       web page. The web page will be displayed by UIWebview.
       
    3. UIImageView, Photo Library, and Camera: When the user presses the button, 
       a action list will show to provide the user sources of images.
       The first source is from Photo Library of iPhone. The second one is from the camera.
       When the user choose the source, a related interface, the Photo Library interface or 
       the Camera interface, will show. After choosing a image, the program will 
       return to the first view and the background image will become the one which is chosen by the user.
